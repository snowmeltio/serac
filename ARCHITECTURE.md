# Serac — Architecture

## Data flow

```
JSONL files (~/.claude/projects/{workspaceKey}/)
    ↓ adaptive polling (500ms active, 2s idle)
JsonlTailer (byte-offset reads, per session)
    ↓ new records
SessionManager (state inference, timer management)
    ↓ snapshots
SessionDiscovery (lifecycle, metadata, sorting)
    ↓ sorted snapshots + usage
AgentPanelProvider (HTML/CSS generation)
    ↓ postMessage
panel.js (DOM reconciliation, FLIP animations)
```

Separately, UsageProvider polls the Anthropic OAuth API every 4-6 minutes and parses local JSONL for per-session costs.

## Source files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `extension.ts` | Entry point. Wires providers, registers commands, starts timers. |
| `sessionManager.ts` | Core state machine. Processes JSONL records, infers session status, manages idle/permission/stale timers. One instance per session. |
| `sessionDiscovery.ts` | Session lifecycle. Discovers JSONL files, manages metadata persistence (`session-meta.json`), sorts snapshots into two-zone order, handles dismiss/acknowledge. |
| `usageProvider.ts` | Usage tracking. OAuth API polling for quota percentages, JSONL parsing for per-session costs, disk caching. |
| `panelProvider.ts` | Webview provider. Generates full HTML/CSS inline, handles webview commands, updates panel badge. |
| `panel.js` | Webview frontend. Keyed DOM reconciler with FLIP animations, status debouncing, ghost filtering, card rendering. |
| `jsonlTailer.ts` | Byte-offset file reader. Tracks read position, buffers incomplete lines across reads. |
| `sessionRepair.ts` | JSONL metadata repair. Reads tail 64KB, appends `custom-title` record if no metadata exists. |
| `transcriptRenderer.ts` | JSONL to markdown converter. Renders user/assistant/system records with tool summaries. |
| `types.ts` | All TypeScript interfaces. SessionState, SessionSnapshot, UsageSnapshot, WebviewMessage, JsonlRecord. |
| `settings.ts` | Typed accessor and change subscriber for the `serac.*` configuration namespace. Single source of truth for defaults. |
| `workflowSidecar.ts` | Pure parser. `parseWorkflowSidecar()` turns a completed run's `wf_<runId>.json` sidecar into a `WorkflowSnapshot`. Never-throw, version-tolerant, in the style of `teamManifest.ts`. |
| `workflowScript.ts` | Static (never-eval) extractors. `extractWorkflowMeta()` pulls `name`/`description`/`phases` from a workflow script's `meta` literal; `extractAgentCalls()` pulls each `agent(prompt, {label, phase})` call's static prompt segments + opts, plus the prompt/label split into ordered `TemplateParts` (statics + interpolation exprs); `matchAgentCall()` correlates a running agent's record-0 prompt back to its call; `recoverInterpolatedLabel()` rebuilds an interpolated label (`audit:${d.key}`) into its real per-agent value (`audit:privacy`) by aligning the prompt template's statics against the expanded prompt. All via brace/string matching. Used for the live tier. |
| `workflowDiscovery.ts` | Two-tier workflow discovery, parallel to `teamDiscovery`. Scans each session dir for sidecars (Tier 1) and live run dirs (Tier 2), caches by mtime, prunes, applies the 7-day age gate and dismiss overlay. |
| `processRegistry.ts` | Reads Claude Code's live process registry (`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`) and confirms each pid with `kill(pid, 0)`. The one source of *actual* process liveness in an otherwise disk-tailing monitor. Owned by `SessionDiscovery` (scanned on a relaxed cadence); exposes `getLiveProcesses()` / `isSessionLive()` / `isActive()`. Injected into each `SessionManager` as a tri-state `livenessProbe` that powers the permission-false-positive gate (a registry-confirmed-dead session can't be `waiting` — see Status inference §6). A hit is a strong positive, a miss is "unknown" (not every session class is guaranteed to register), and an inactive registry disables the gate. `isScanClean()` distinguishes a degraded scan (a non-ENOENT read error or unparseable content on a *present* file) from genuine absence, so a transient disk error on a live session's file degrades the probe to "unknown" rather than "dead" — only a clean scan's absence is trusted as death. |
| `detailPanel.ts` | Source-keyed editor-area webview host (`createWebviewPanel`, `ViewColumn.Beside`). One reused instance serves three drill-ins (workflow / team / subagents); builds a normalised `DetailModel` per source (with a cross-source view switcher for session-card sources) and resolves agent transcripts on demand via injected deps. Dedups re-pushes (`lastPushed` JSON compare). |
| `detailView.ts` | Detail-panel webview frontend. Two-pane navigator: left = collapsible groups → agents, right = transcript reader led by the agent's inception brief. Renders any `DetailModel` generically; redeclares its own view types (separate bundle). Clears its transcript cache when the drill-in identity (source + container) changes. |
| `detailViewScroll.ts` | Pure scroll-intent decision for the detail reader (agent change → top; at-bottom → live tail; scrolled up → preserve). Extracted because jsdom has no layout. |
| `teammateInbox.ts` | Serac's only write into `~/.claude/`: hardened append to a team member's inbox (realpath/lstat confinement, atomic `wx`+rename, `O_NOFOLLOW` + size-capped read, schema-strict kill-switch, NFKC + control/bidi rejection, per-inbox serialised queue, byte-accurate ring buffer). |
| `hookEventRouter.ts` | Fan-out + buffer-with-TTL for inbound Claude Code hook events; fed by `hookIngress/`, consumed by per-session tracker subscribers. |
| `hookIngress/` | Inbound hook transport: Unix-socket server + leader election (one listener across windows) + the forwarder handshake (`bin/serac-hook-forward.cjs`). |
| `trackers/` | Non-status enrichment slices (background shells, tool outcomes, permission timing, hook enrichment) — they never move `running`/`waiting`/`done`. |
| `teamDiscovery.ts` / `teamManifest.ts` | Agent Teams discovery (`~/.claude/teams/`), config parsing, workspace scoping, inbox target resolution. |
| `foreignWorkspaceManager.ts` / `siblingWorktreeManager.ts` / `worktreeRows.ts` | Out-of-window sections: foreign-workspace rows/strips and sibling-worktree cards. |
| `subagentTailerManager.ts` | Subagent transcript tailing + silent-subagent file scanning. |
| `validation.ts` | Webview→host message validation (the webview is untrusted). |
| `panelUtils.ts` / `footerSlots.ts` / `paths.ts` / `jsonlValidator.ts` / `gitWorktreeUtil.ts` / `claudeSettings.ts` / `toolProfiles.ts` / `workspaceOpener.ts` | Support modules: pure pill/format helpers, footer slot layout, path mapping, record validation, worktree enumeration, CC settings reads, the canonical tool-profile table, focus-safe workspace opening. |

The table is curated, not exhaustive — see `src/` for the full list.

## Status inference

### States

| Status | Meaning | Visual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `running` | Agent is actively processing | Blue border, spinner |
| `waiting` | Waiting for user (permission prompt or AskUserQuestion) | Orange border, pulsing pill |
| `done` | Turn complete, not yet acknowledged by user | Teal border |
| `stale` | Display-only: `done` + acknowledged + 10s elapsed | Grey border |
| `idle` | Display-only: queued (`enqueue`) but not yet dequeued | Grey border |

### Transitions

```
done ──→ running          (user record arrives, dequeue, or compact_boundary)
running ──→ waiting       (AskUserQuestion, permission timer 3s/15s, all subagents blocked)
running ──→ done          (idle timer 5s, all-subagents-done, hard ceiling 3min, or Stop hook)
waiting ──→ running       (sidechain tool_result unblocks subagents, user record)
waiting ──→ done          (waiting hard ceiling 10min, or registry-confirmed process death)
running ──→ done          (registry-confirmed process death)
any ──→ done              (queue-operation: enqueue, JSONL truncation)
done ──→ stale            (display-only: acknowledged + 10s elapsed)
```

Internal statuses are `running | waiting | done`. `stale` and `idle` are display-only labels applied in `SessionDiscovery.getSnapshots()` and `panel.ts`.

### Timer hierarchy

`turn_duration` system records were never observed in production JSONL and were removed as a state signal in v0.9. Status now derives from record cadence and tool-completion signals.

1. **Tool completion signals** — `tool_result` blocks remove tools from `activeTools`; the all-subagents-done shortcut marks orchestrator turns complete immediately.
2. **Permission timer** — heuristic for stuck permission prompts. Base delay **3s** for normal tools, **15s** for slow tools (Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Skill, Monitor, MCP). Doubled (max **6s/30s**) if a tool result arrived within the last 3s, to absorb sequential auto-approved tools. The slow delay is deliberately generous: the `PermissionRequest` hook ingress is wired (socket server + leader election + forwarder), but until its positive path is validated against real captured payloads the timer remains the load-bearing signal, and a timer alone cannot distinguish a slow-*executing* tool from one *blocked* on a prompt — a long Bash (test/build/package) must be given time to finish before it is mistaken for a wait. See `permissionTracker.ts` FALSE-POSITIVE NOTE.
3. **Idle timer (5s)** — fires only if status is `running` AND output has been seen in this turn AND no blocking subagents are active.
4. **Extended thinking grace (30s)** — first 30s of a turn with no output yet uses PID-liveness check instead of demoting (covers slow first-token).
5. **Hard ceiling (3 min running, 10 min waiting)** — safety net; forces done regardless of state. Covers laptop sleep, quota hits, abandoned permission prompts.
6. **Registry-confirmed death (permission-FP gate)** — `demoteIfStale` resolves a `running`/`waiting` session to `done` at once (ahead of the hard ceiling) when the process-liveness registry (`processRegistry.ts`) confirms the backing process has exited; the same check suppresses the permission timer firing a false `waiting`. A dead process can't be blocked on a prompt, so this kills the stale "Waiting for your response". Conservative by design: it fires only when the session was *seen live in the registry before* and is now gone (`isConfirmedDeadByRegistry()` latches `everSeenLiveInRegistry`), so a session class the registry never tracks is never wrongly silenced, and an absent/empty registry is a no-op.
7. **`Stop` hook (when present)** — accelerates `running → done` to the instant the turn ends, ahead of the 5s idle timer. Sets the `turnEndedByStop` guard so the turn's trailing assistant record (polled 0.5–2s later) cannot re-fire `running`; the guard is released by the next genuine new-turn reopener (user record, `dequeue`, or `compact_boundary`) or on `resetState`. Pure acceleration — `done` is still reached by the idle timer when no hook arrives, so hookless sessions are unchanged. See "Hook consumption".

### Out-of-order tool_use/tool_result

Claude Code's JSONL writer occasionally flushes a `tool_result` record before its
matching `tool_use` (file order reversed despite an earlier wall-clock timestamp on
the `tool_use`). Without compensation, the late `tool_use` adds an entry to
`activeTools` that nothing ever clears, and `demoteIfStale` falsely promotes the
session to `'waiting'` after 30 s of silence. `SessionManager.earlyToolResults`
tracks IDs whose `tool_result` arrived first, so the late `tool_use` can be skipped.

### Permission-exempt tools

These tools never trigger permission wait detection: `Agent`, `Task`, `TodoWrite`, `ToolSearch`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Edit`, `Write`, `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode`, `EnterWorktree`, `ExitWorktree`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`, `CronList`, `RemoteTrigger`, `PushNotification`, `TaskOutput`, `TaskStop`, `SendMessage`, `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, `NotebookEdit`. See `toolProfiles.ts` for the canonical list.

### Subagent permission bubbling

Each subagent runs its own permission timer against `subagent.activeTools`. When it fires, the subagent is marked `waitingOnPermission`. The parent only transitions to `waiting` when **all** running subagents are blocked — a single-subagent block doesn't bubble if other subagents are still progressing.

Subagents are further classified for demotion:
- **Blocking subagent** — `parentToolUseId` is still in the parent's `activeTools` (parent waiting for the Task/Agent result). Suppresses parent demotion.
- **Background subagent** — parent has moved on (`parentToolUseId` no longer in `activeTools`). Does NOT suppress demotion; parent can demote to `done` while the background subagent finishes.

### Detached (run_in_background) agents

An `Agent` call with `run_in_background: true` returns its `tool_result`
**instantly**, and that result is only the launch banner ("Async agent launched
successfully…") — not the agent's output. Treating it as completion made cards
read `DONE` while detached agents kept working for many minutes (found live
2026-06-11). The corrected model (`sessionManager.ts`,
`sessionManager.backgroundAgent.test.ts`):

- **Launch** — the banner on an Agent/Task `tool_result` (string-matched, same
  brittleness charter as the shell tracker; fail-safe is the old
  banner-as-completion behaviour) flags the subagent `background: true`, keeps
  it `running`, and adopts the `agentId:` from the banner so the Phase 2 tailer
  opens `subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` at its exact path.
- **Turn end** — `done` stays turn-scoped: the idle/Stop path still closes the
  turn (a background agent is non-blocking), but `markSessionDone()` exempts
  live background agents from its completion sweep — their tailers and
  permission trackers stay alive under the done card.
- **Completion** — the harness-injected `<task-notification>` user record in
  the **main** JSONL (carries `<task-id>` = agentId, `<tool-use-id>`,
  `<status>`, `<result>`). It completes the matched subagent (the `<result>`
  becomes `resultPreview`, non-`completed` statuses are prefixed `[status]`)
  and, being a user record, reopens the turn — matching the harness, which
  re-invokes the lead.
- **Backstops** — `sweepBackgroundWork()` (the per-poll dormant sweep, shared
  with background shells): registry-confirmed death completes all background
  agents at once; otherwise an agent whose own JSONL has sat unmodified past
  `BACKGROUND_AGENT_CEILING_MS` (15 min) is force-completed (missed/never-written
  notification). File mtime, not `subagent.lastActivity`, is the liveness
  source — it survives replay and works without tailer pumping.
- **Dormant pumping** — the discovery poll loop treats a dormant session with
  live background agents as woken, so `update()` keeps pumping its subagent
  tailers (roster rows, tool counts, permission detection) while the main JSONL
  is quiet.
- **Display** — the card's agents chip (`🤖 N →`) counts live agents (workflow
  agents + subagents, background included) and tints by their aggregate state
  via `detailChipState`, so a `done` card with live robots reads as active down
  in the meta row; live agents also keep their inline roster rows on done cards.

### Background-shell signal (SPIKE — non-status enrichment)

A `Bash` launched with `run_in_background: true` returns its `tool_result`
immediately ("Command running in background with ID: `<id>`"), so the turn ends
and the idle/`Stop` path correctly marks the session `done` — while a detached
build/deploy keeps running, invisible to the JSONL until the agent retrieves it
in a later turn. `BackgroundShellTracker` (`trackers/backgroundShellTracker.ts`)
tracks those outstanding shells purely for display: it is **strictly
non-status** (same charter as `ToolOutcomeTracker`) and never moves
`running`/`waiting`/`done` — `done` still means the turn ended, which is true.

- **Source:** main-thread `tool_result` text only (string-matched, hence
  brittle — these are Claude Code surface strings, not an API). Launch banner
  adds a shell; a terminal retrieval (`<task_id>` + `<status>completed|failed|
  killed|…</status>`) clears it. A `<status>running</status>` poll does not.
- **Clearing (three paths):** (1) a terminal retrieval clears its shell on the
  normal update path; (2) a shell never observed completing is pruned after
  `BACKGROUND_SHELL_CEILING_MS` (15 min), mirroring the status ceilings so the
  signal can't stick forever; (3) confirmed process death clears all outstanding
  shells at once. Paths 2–3 run in `SessionManager.sweepBackgroundWork(now)`,
  which the poll loop calls over **dormant** (done/stale/idle) sessions every
  cycle — decoupled from mtime/new-data, because an idle `done` card never
  re-enters `demoteIfStale` and would otherwise never prune or clear. The sweep
  returns true when the count actually drops so `pollInner` sets `changed` and
  pushes the cleared badge (a `done` card's status never changes, so the demote
  path alone would never trigger a push). The death clear reuses the conservative
  registry tri-state (`isConfirmedDeadByRegistry()`, same as the permission-FP
  gate above).
- **Surface:** `SessionSnapshot.backgroundShellCount` (undefined when none),
  carried through to the webview on `PanelSession`.
- **Display:** rendered as a quiet `.bg-shell-badge` ("⚙ N shell(s) running",
  running-accent tint) in the card meta row by `panel.ts:renderCardInner`,
  whenever the count is `> 0` — on any status, including `done`. The badge is
  additive and never changes the card's status class, so the flicker-prone
  status path stays untouched. Ungated: the count is only non-zero when
  detection fires, and the fail-safe on a wording change is to show nothing.

### Loops badge (pendingWakeup / session crons)

`trackers/sessionLoopTracker.ts` — non-status enrichment (BackgroundShellTracker
charter) answering "finished, or just sleeping?". A `ScheduleWakeup` tool_use
(input `{delaySeconds, reason, prompt}`) sets a pending wakeup that self-expires
at fire time and is cleared by any later genuine user-text turn (the fired
prompt lands as one). `CronCreate`/`CronDelete` maintain a session-cron count
(job ids paired leniently from create-result text; entries also carry the
server-side 7-day expiry ceiling). When hooks are live, every `Stop` payload's
`session_crons` is applied as ground truth (empty clears, populated replaces).
Registry-confirmed death clears everything (a dead session has no scheduler).
Surfaced as `SessionSnapshot.pendingWakeupAt/-Reason` and
`sessionCronCount/-Label`; rendered as quiet `sleeping · Xm` / `loop` chips in
the card meta row (same `.bg-shell-badge` chrome).

### Orphan/live annotation (processLive)

`SessionSnapshot.processLive` is the registry tri-state surfaced for display:
`true` = the CC process is registered live right now (a `done` card is
resumable in its terminal), `false` = seen live before and now absent
(confirmed ended), `undefined` = can't say (no probe, degraded scan, or never
seen live). Computed by `SessionManager.registryLiveness()`, the same helper
(and the same persisted seen-live latch) behind `isConfirmedDeadByRegistry()`
— so a snapshot render latches evidence the death-gate later relies on.
Rendered only on terminal cards as a quiet `live`/`ended` qualifier inside the
status pill (`panelUtils.ts:getStatusLabel`); active cards are never
annotated, and the unknown state shows nothing rather than guessing.

## Hook consumption

> Status: **implemented 2026-06-01** — `TurnLifecycleTracker`,
> `ToolOutcomeTracker`, `SessionLifecycleTracker`; `HOOK_EVENTS` gained
> `SessionEnd`/`PreCompact` and lost `SubagentStart`. Panel rendering of the
> enrichment fields (`lastTool`, `permissionMode`, `endReason`) is the remaining
> follow-up: the data is on the snapshot but not yet drawn on the card.

> Red-teamed twice. Draft 1's authority/coverage model was rejected (see
> **Rejected: the authority model**). Draft 2's "acceleration is order-free via
> idempotency" claim was found **false for `Stop`** — see **The `Stop` turn-close
> guard**. `Notification`→`waiting` and `SubagentStart` consumption were
> investigated and dropped (AskUserQuestion is already covered by
> `PermissionRequest`; `SubagentStart` can't bridge to `parentToolUseId` at spawn).

### Principle: two roles

Hooks serve two roles. The split removes most cross-source arbitration — but not
all of it, which Draft 2 got wrong.

1. **Accelerators for status.** A hook fires a status transition JSONL would
   reach anyway, only earlier.
   - **Same-transition accelerators are order-free.** `setStatus` no-ops on
     same-status, so a hook and JSONL firing the *same* transition is idempotent
     regardless of order. The permission→`waiting` path is like this:
     `PermissionRequest` and the JSONL tool path both fire `waiting`.
   - **`Stop`→`done` is the exception — NOT same-transition, NOT order-free.**
     `Stop` fires `done`; the turn's trailing JSONL assistant record fires
     `running` via `setRunning()` ([sessionManager.ts:763](src/sessionManager.ts#L763)).
     Different transitions ⇒ not idempotent ⇒ a per-turn `done→running→done`
     flicker unless guarded. See the next subsection.
2. **Enrichment via dedicated snapshot fields.** `PostToolUse` (tool duration +
   outcome), `PreToolUse` (permission mode), and `SessionEnd` (end reason) carry
   data JSONL lacks. They write **dedicated snapshot fields** (`lastTool`,
   `permissionMode`, `endReason`) — **not** the shared `activity` line and
   **never** status. This is deliberate: the hook fires ahead of the JSONL poll,
   so writing `activity` would be clobbered by a *stale* later-arriving JSONL
   `tool_use` (arrival-order, not event-order — the exact race Draft 2
   over-claimed immunity to). A dedicated field sidesteps it entirely.
   - **Exception — `PreCompact` is a status-stabiliser, not enrichment.** It
     opens the compacting grace window (below): holds `running`/high-confidence
     and suppresses demotion. It is the one lifecycle event that touches status.

This is **observe-only.** Serac's forwarder always exits `0` and never returns a
blocking, deny, or context-injection decision. Consuming more events never gives
Serac a vote in what the agent does — only a clearer view of what it did. The
exit-0 guarantee in `bin/serac-hook-forward.cjs` is the guardrail; it must not
change.

### The `Stop` turn-close guard

`Stop` must **not** bypass the idle path by calling `markSessionDone()` directly.
The turn's trailing assistant record is polled 0.5–2s later, hits the text-only
branch of `processAssistantRecord` → `setRunning()`, flipping `done→running`;
the 5s idle timer then re-demotes — a per-turn flicker that is *worse* than
today's single clean `running→done`.

The fix uses the reopener taxonomy. `done→running` has exactly four sources
([sessionManager.ts:15-20](src/sessionManager.ts#L15)): user record, `dequeue`,
trailing assistant record, and `compact_boundary`. A *legitimate* new turn always
begins with one of the first, second, or fourth — so a bare assistant record
after `Stop` is, by construction, trailing data of the turn that just ended.

- `Stop` sets a `turnEndedByStop` flag and marks done.
- While the flag is set, `processAssistantRecord`'s `setRunning()` is
  **suppressed** (trailing records cannot reopen), as is `activeTools`
  repopulation from a trailing `tool_use`.
- A `user` / `dequeue` / `compact_boundary` record **clears** the flag and
  proceeds normally — a real new turn.

State-based, ~10 lines, no timestamp/clock dependency. The flag lives at the
**SessionManager host edge**, not inside a tracker slice, because it coordinates
`setRunning`, `activeTools`, and the idle timer.

### JSONL stays the status backstop — at full strength

Because hooks only *accelerate* status, the existing JSONL heuristics are **not
demoted** when hooks are present:

- The **idle timer**, **extended-thinking grace**, and especially the
  **PID-liveness check** keep running at full cadence. This is deliberate: when
  Claude Code *crashes* mid-turn, no `Stop` fires — and the hook channel is dead
  exactly when you need it. PID-liveness is the only thing that catches a dead
  process fast, so it must never be gated behind "hooks are live."
- A session that emits no hooks at all (started before hooks were installed, or
  running in a non-leader VS Code window) behaves **exactly as it does today**.
  No per-session capability flag is required; absence of acceleration is just the
  current path.

### Signal map

| Hook event | Registered today | Plan | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Stop` | ✅ | **consume (new)** | accelerate `done` — with the turn-close guard |
| `PostToolUse` | ✅ | **consume (new)** | enrichment: `duration_ms`, outcome, response preview |
| `PreToolUse` | ✅ | **consume (new)** | enrichment: intent, `permission_mode`, deny-by-rule |
| `PermissionRequest` | ✅ | consumed + `tool_name`-keyed label (done) | ground-truth `waiting` for permission **and** AskUserQuestion; label keys off the tool's `userInput` profile, and `userInput` tools bypass the active-tool gate to accelerate ahead of JSONL |
| `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `SubagentStop` | ✅ | already consumed | cwd, compact boundary, subagent lifecycle |
| `SubagentStart` | ✅ | **drop / de-register** | payload has `agent_id` but no `tool_use_id`; can't bridge to the `parentToolUseId`-keyed subagent model at spawn → double-counts |
| `Notification` | ❌ | **do not add** | `permission_prompt` is redundant with `PermissionRequest` (verified: AskUserQuestion fires both); only unique variant `idle_prompt` is a nudge about an already-waiting session and is ignored |
| `SessionEnd` | ❌ | **add (initial)** | enrichment: end reason (clear/logout/prompt_input_exit/other) |
| `PreCompact` | ❌ | **add (initial)** | **status-stabiliser**: opens a compacting grace window (holds `running`/high-confidence, suppresses idle-demotion + survives truncation) until `compact_boundary` or timeout; carries `trigger` (manual/auto) |

Steps 1–2 register **nothing new** — `Stop`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` are already
in `HOOK_EVENTS`. Only the later enrichment phase adds `SessionEnd`/`PreCompact`.
`SubagentStart` should be **removed** from `HOOK_EVENTS` to stop paying a forwarder
spawn per subagent for an event nothing consumes.

### Caveats (resolved / settled)

- **`stop_hook_active`.** `Stop`/`SubagentStop` payloads carry this flag (`false`
  in every capture). A `Stop` with `stop_hook_active: true` is a
  continuation-triggered stop, not a turn end — the `Stop` consumer must ignore
  those or it will close a turn that is still running.
- **`notification_type` (informational, since `Notification` is dropped).** The
  payload discriminates `permission_prompt` from `idle_prompt`. We verified
  `permission_prompt` is redundant with `PermissionRequest` (AskUserQuestion
  fires *both*), so `Notification` is not consumed at all. Kept here only so a
  future reader doesn't re-derive it.

### Cost (benchmarked 2026-06-01)

- **Steps 1–2 add ≈ zero forwarder cost.** `Stop`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` are
  already registered and already spawn `serac-hook-forward.cjs` on every tool
  call — today they're just dropped at the router. Consuming them adds only a
  synchronous router dispatch + a field write.
- **`SessionEnd`/`PreCompact` add negligible cost** — they fire once per session
  end / compaction, not per tool call.
- **The forwarder is over its own spec, independently of this work.**
  `scripts/bench-forwarder.cjs`: min 38ms / p50 40ms / p95 71ms / max 603ms
  against a `<30ms` cold-spawn target — node cold-start per event. This is a
  pre-existing per-tool latency tax on *all* hooked tool calls; worth a separate
  cleanup (persistent helper or compiled forwarder), not a blocker for consuming.

### Where it lives

New consumers follow the existing tracker convention (`src/trackers/README.md`):
one slice of state, a host interface for callbacks, a factory hiding the source.

- **`TurnLifecycleTracker`** — consumes `Stop` to accelerate `done`. The
  turn-close guard (`turnEndedByStop` flag + suppression of trailing
  `setRunning`/`activeTools`) lives at the **SessionManager host edge**, not in
  the tracker slice, because it coordinates `setRunning`, `activeTools`, and the
  idle timer. The existing `seenOutputInTurn` / idle / PID-liveness logic stays
  as the JSONL backstop and keeps running.
- **`ToolOutcomeTracker`** — consumes `PostToolUse` (→ `lastTool`) and
  `PreToolUse` (→ `permissionMode`). Non-authoritative; writes dedicated snapshot
  fields, never status and never the `activity` line.
- **`SessionLifecycleTracker`** — consumes `SessionEnd` (enrichment: end reason,
  no status effect) and `PreCompact` (status-stabiliser). `PreCompact` opens a
  **compacting grace window** at the SessionManager host edge: while open, the
  session holds `running` at high confidence, the idle timer does not demote, and
  `resetState` (triggered by compaction's JSONL truncation) must **preserve** the
  window so the card doesn't flip to `done` mid-compaction. The window closes on
  the existing `compact_boundary` signal (handled by `CompactBoundaryTracker`) or
  a timeout. This fixes the observed mid-compaction `running`→`done` flip and
  confidence decay. `SessionEnd` itself never moves status (enrichment-only
  unless an `ended` display state is added later — see Status inference).

(`NotificationTracker` from the prior draft is dropped — see signal map.)

### Implementation order (single initial build)

`SessionEnd` and `PreCompact` are in the initial build, not deferred.

1. **`Stop` → accelerate `done`** (`TurnLifecycleTracker` + host-edge turn-close
   guard). Build the guard first — it *is* the feature. Already registered.
2. **`PostToolUse`/`PreToolUse` enrichment** (`ToolOutcomeTracker`) → dedicated
   `lastTool`/`permissionMode` snapshot fields. Already registered; marginal cost ≈ 0.
3. **`SessionEnd`/`PreCompact` enrichment** (`SessionLifecycleTracker`). Add both
   to `HOOK_EVENTS`, remove `SubagentStart`, re-patch settings, then consume.

Independent follow-ups (both done 2026-06-01):
- **AskUserQuestion acceleration + `tool_name`-keyed label** (done). The
  `PermissionRequest` subscriber now threads the event's `tool_name` to
  `onWaitingFired(toolName?)`, which keys the activity label off the tool's
  `userInput` profile (AskUserQuestion → "Waiting for your response", else
  "Waiting for permission"). The timer variant passes no `toolName` and the host
  falls back to scanning `activeTools`. **Gate nuance:** the `activeTools`-non-empty
  gate is bypassed *only* for `userInput` tools, so AskUserQuestion accelerates
  to `waiting` ahead of its JSONL `tool_use` record (activeTools still empty),
  while non-input tools keep the gate — otherwise the trailing JSONL `setRunning`
  would flip them `waiting → running`. Safe because the JSONL path *re-affirms*
  `waiting` for `userInput` tools rather than running them.
- **Forwarder perf cleanup** (done) — see Cost. Lazy-`require('node:net')` on the
  no-socket fast path, `SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS` 1000 → 250 to cap tail latency, and an
  honest bench that reports overhead above the ~30 ms Node-boot floor (≈5 ms) rather
  than an unachievable sub-30 ms absolute.

Each step degrades cleanly to today's behaviour when no hook arrives.

### Rejected: the authority model

The first draft made hooks *authoritative* for status, with:
- a per-session coverage state machine (`unknown`/`live`/`degraded`), and
- a "causal-recency-wins" rule letting the latest-processed record from either
  source override the other, and
- demotion of JSONL heuristics (including PID-liveness) under `live` coverage.

Rejected because:
- **Causal-recency was wrong across async channels.** Hooks arrive on a push
  socket; JSONL is polled 500ms–2s later. A `Stop` is almost always *processed*
  before its own turn's trailing JSONL is read off disk, so "latest processed
  wins" would let stale JSONL reopen a hook-closed turn — flicker on every turn,
  not a corner case.
- **The machinery was unjustified.** It existed only to arbitrate two sources
  both claiming a *status*. The two-roles split removes that need entirely:
  acceleration is idempotent, enrichment has no rival source.
- **Demoting PID-liveness was a crash-detection regression** — see "JSONL stays
  the status backstop" above.

Reintroduce an authority model only if a concrete case appears where JSONL infers
a **durably wrong** terminal status (not merely a *late* one) that a hook must
override — or where `Stop`/`Notification` prove unreliable enough that JSONL must
*cross-check* rather than *backstop* them.

## Usage model

### OAuth API (primary)

- Endpoint: `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`
- Auth: Bearer token from macOS Keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`) or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
- Response: `five_hour.utilization`, `seven_day.utilization`, per-model weekly quotas, extra usage info
- Polling: 4-6 minute randomised interval with 10-15 minute cooldown between API calls
- Cache: `~/.claude/usage-cache.json` with 15-minute TTL
- Fallback: reuse last successful response on transient failures (429, network errors)

## Webview rendering

### Message protocol

**Extension to webview:** Three message types:
- `update` — all session snapshots, usage data, needs-input count, and workspace path. A 200ms debounce guard prevents double-renders when onChange callbacks and the refresh timer overlap.
- `focusSession` — sets `focusedSessionId` and re-renders with highlight. Used when a new chat is detected after the user clicks "+ New".
- `settings` — the current `serac.*` configuration snapshot. Posted once on `resolveWebviewView` (before the first `update` so the very first render sees the right visibility / heights) and again whenever `onDidChangeConfiguration` fires. Held separate from `update` because settings change rarely and updates are noisy.

**Webview to extension:** Command messages (focusSession, dismissSession, undismissSession, viewTranscript, newChat, cleanup, copyToClipboard, requestUpdate).

### New chat detection

When the user clicks "+ New", the extension snapshots known session IDs and opens a new Claude Code editor panel. The JSONL file only appears when the user sends their first message, so a fixed polling timer would expire before detection. Instead, a `pendingNewChatKnownIds` set persists across poll cycles. On each `sendUpdate()`, if the set is active, any session not in it is treated as the new chat — focused in the panel and the set is cleared.

### DOM reconciliation

The webview uses a keyed reconciler (not innerHTML replacement). Cards are matched by session ID; new cards fade in, removed cards fade out (at half duration, scaled down and stacked beneath in-flow cards), reordered cards animate via FLIP (First, Last, Invert, Play) with 300ms CSS transitions.

The FLIP "First" snapshot is taken once per render, across both the active and done card sections, before any layout mutation. A card whose status flips section (running→done) is therefore a *move*, not an exit-plus-enter: the old element is removed outright and the new one FLIP-slides from the snapshot position. Because the snapshot captures painted positions (including any in-flight transform), a render landing mid-animation continues the move from where the card visually is. Animation state is committed with forced reflows (batched per phase), not rAF pairs, so transitions play deterministically under the 5s tick plus event-driven render bursts.

### Status debouncing

A 2-second debounce prevents flicker during rapid `needs-input → running → needs-input` cycles that occur when sequential tool permissions are approved.

### Ghost filtering

Sessions with no topic and no activity in idle/stale status are silently filtered from the display.

### Card name display priority

`customTitle` > `title` (from session-meta.json) > `topic` (first user message) > folder name > slug > session ID.

### Foreign workspace worktree picker

When `groupForeignWorkspaces` aggregates 2+ foreign workspaces sharing a `repoRoot`, the synthetic row becomes click-to-expand (chevron, no `data-cwd`). Expanding inlines one child row per worktree of the repo (read from `<repoRoot>/.git/worktrees/*` by `ForeignWorkspaceManager`, refreshed on the same 60s cadence as the local `discoveredWorktrees`). Per-worktree counts come from the pre-aggregation `members` preserved on the synthetic row. Inactive worktrees (no Claude Code activity within the foreign-workspace age gate, `ageGateDaysFor('foreignWorkspaces')`) still appear, marked with a quiet "no activity" tag. Picking a worktree posts `openWorkspace` and auto-collapses the parent; an idle expand collapses after `serac.worktrees.autoCollapseAfterSeconds`.

#### `/private/tmp` pseudo-repository

Scratch sessions under the temp root aren't git repos, so each would otherwise show as its own flat "Other workspaces" row. When `serac.worktrees.consolidateTmp` is on, `ForeignWorkspaceManager.getWorkspaces` overlays a synthetic `repoRoot` of `PSEUDO_TMP_REPO_ROOT` (`/private/tmp`) onto any workspace whose cwd is under `/private/tmp` or `/tmp` (`isTmpScratchPath`) **and** has no real git `repoRoot`. The overlay is applied at read time, not baked into `repoRootCache`, so toggling the setting takes effect on the next poll without a cache flush. `groupForeignWorkspaces` then folds these into one `tmp` row flagged `pseudoRepo: true`. Because a pseudo root has no `.git`, there are no enumerated worktrees: the row withholds `cwd` (no canonical checkout to open), its chip reuses the `Nwt` suffix marked with a `*` (e.g. `2wt*`, explained in the chip tooltip — they aren't real git worktrees, and `Nd` was avoided since `d` reads as the Done count or "days"), and the inline picker is driven by `members` (one child per scratch dir, no main/detached/no-activity hints) rather than `worktrees`. Real git-repo aggregation is unaffected.

## Configuration

The extension exposes a `serac.*` namespace via `package.json#contributes.configuration`. Reads go through a single typed accessor in `src/settings.ts` — with one deliberate exception: `serac.hooks.*` is read directly in `extension.ts` (and written via `hookSettings/patcher.ts`), because hook enable/debug gates run before the settings snapshot exists.

- **Reading:** `readSettings(): SeracSettings` returns a complete snapshot, falling back to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` for any unset key. Defaults match the historical hardcoded constants so an upgrade with no `serac.*` keys behaves identically.
- **Reactivity:** `onSettingsChanged(cb)` wraps `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration` and fires the callback with a fresh snapshot whenever any `serac.*` key changes. `extension.ts` posts a new `settings` message to the webview and (when `serac.refresh.intervalSeconds` changed) rebuilds the refresh timer.
- **Webview side:** `panel.ts` caches the last received `SettingsMessage` in `currentSettings`. Render functions consult it directly for visibility gates (`show.foreignWorkspaces`, `show.worktrees`, `show.usage`, `show.subagents`), thresholds (`usage.warnAtPercent`, `usage.criticalAtPercent`), and limits (`archive.maxDoneShown`, `worktrees.autoCollapseAfterSeconds`).
- **Discovery managers** (`foreignWorkspaceManager`, `siblingWorktreeManager`, `teamDiscovery`, `workflowDiscovery`) call `readSettings()` at the top of `scan()` / `poll()` to:
  - Short-circuit when the corresponding `show.*` setting is false (no background work for hidden sections).
  - Resolve their section's age gate via `ageGateDaysFor(section)`. `discovery.ageGateDays` is the inherited base; each section (`foreignWorkspaces`, `worktrees`, `teams`, `workflows`) may override it with `discovery.<section>AgeGateDays` (null = inherit). The resolver is the only supported read path, so the inherit-when-unset rule lives in one place; a non-positive or absent override falls back to the base rather than disabling the gate.
  - "Other workspaces" additionally honours `discovery.foreignWorkspacesWindow` (preset enum: `inherit` / `live-only` / `1d` / `7d` / `30d` / `forever`), resolved via `settings.foreignWindowGate()` into `{ liveOnly, ageGateMs }` and applied in `ForeignWorkspaceManager.withinWindow()`. In `live-only` mode the process-registry answer wins outright (live = shown regardless of age, confirmed-absent = hidden regardless of youth); a degraded or unwired registry falls back to the time window so a transient scan problem can't blank the section. Active (running/waiting) sessions are never window-evicted — the registry death-gate demotes them first, then the dormant poll branch evicts.
- **CSS reactivity:** Heights and animation timings are CSS custom properties on `:root` (`--serac-foreign-max-height`, `--serac-worktrees-max-height`, `--serac-transition-ms`, `--serac-foreign-slide-ms`), set by `applySettings()` in the webview. A `maxHeightPx` of `0` maps to `none` (no cap). `.card-archive-scroll` has a fixed `min-height: 200px` so cards can never be collapsed by the workspace/worktree panes; `#root` uses `overflow-y: auto` so the whole panel scrolls when the combined content exceeds the viewport.
- **Per-workspace overrides:** All settings inherit VS Code's standard layering — user settings → workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`). Free, no additional plumbing.

## Session metadata

Consolidated in `session-meta.json` per workspace:

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "<sessionId>": {
      "title": null,
      "dismissed": false,
      "acknowledged": false,
      "acknowledgedAt": null,
      "firstSeen": 1741500000000
    }
  }
}
```

Reloaded every poll cycle (500ms active, 2s idle), enabling external processes to update metadata. Legacy migration from `dismissed-sessions` and `acknowledged-sessions` text files happens on first load.

## Session repair

`sessionRepair.ts` ensures JSONL files have metadata for Claude extension discovery. If no user text is found (e.g. session is too new), repair is skipped — no fallback title is written. The display layer (`getDisplayName` in panel.js) also treats `Session [hex]{8}` titles as placeholders and falls through to topic/slug/cwd.

1. Read last 64KB of JSONL file
2. Check for existing `custom-title`, `last-prompt`, or `summary` records
3. If none found, scan full file for first user message text
4. Append a `custom-title` JSONL record with extracted title (max 200 chars)
5. Failures are silently suppressed (non-critical path)

Called on session focus and undismiss operations.

## Workflow discovery

Serac surfaces Claude Code **Workflow** runs (the built-in fan-out orchestration tool; first shipped with Opus 4.8, now generally available across models) as ordinary session cards. The pipeline mirrors the Agent Teams path: `WorkflowDiscovery` → `WorkflowSnapshot` → `panelProvider` → `panel.js`, owned by `SessionDiscovery` alongside `teamDiscovery`.

### On-disk model

Per parent session at `~/.claude/projects/<workspaceKey>/<sessionId>/`:

- `workflows/wf_<runId>.json` — the **completion-only** sidecar (written once, at the end of the run). Render-ready: top-level roll-ups plus a `workflowProgress[]` array interleaving `workflow_phase` and `workflow_agent` entries (`phaseIndex` is 1-based). Embeds the full script and result blobs, so it is 48–85 KB+ — read lazily and cache by mtime.
- `workflows/scripts/<name>-<runId>.js` — the script. Begins with `export const meta = { name, description, phases }`. **Never eval'd** — `workflowScript.ts` extracts the meta statically.
- `subagents/workflows/<runId>/agent-<agentId>.jsonl` — per-agent transcripts in the same `isSidechain` format the renderer already handles; `journal.jsonl` records `started`/`result` pairs.

### Two tiers

- **Tier 1 — completed (sidecar present), the common case.** `parseWorkflowSidecar()` reproduces the `/workflows` phase-grouped tree exactly: phase grouping, per-agent tokens/tools/duration/state, roll-up metrics, and `log()` narrator lines all read directly. Zero correlation, no heuristics.
- **Tier 2 — live (run dir exists, no sidecar yet).** Phase scaffold from the script's `meta.phases`; agents listed from the journal. Each running agent is correlated back to its phase by `extractAgentCalls()` (the static `agent(prompt, {label, phase})` call sites, never eval'd) matched against the agent's record-0 prompt: the longest distinctive *static* segment of a call's prompt that appears verbatim in the expanded prompt wins (interpolated `${...}` parts differ per agent, so we key off the static text around them). An agent whose prompt is a bare expression (e.g. `agent(c.prompt)` in a loop) has no static segment to match, so it falls back to a flat, ungrouped entry labelled by its journal key. Low-stakes either way: completion immediately materialises the perfect sidecar. Stale live runs that never produce a sidecar (killed/abandoned) are filtered by the 7-day age gate and marked `incomplete`.
  - **Agent labels.** A plain literal `label` is used as-is. An *interpolated* label (`` `audit:${d.key}` ``, shared by all fan-out agents of one call site) is resolved per-agent by `recoverInterpolatedLabel()`: it aligns the prompt template's static segments against this agent's expanded prompt to read the runtime value of each `${…}` (the label and prompt share the same scope, so an expr like `d.key` appearing in both is recoverable), giving distinct rows (`audit:privacy`, `audit:security`, …). When recovery fails it falls back to a phase-scoped, agent-distinct label (`Audit · <shortId>`). A raw `${…}` is **never** surfaced to the webview. (The completion sidecar carries real per-agent labels from the runtime and bypasses all of this.)

### Status mapping

The sidecar's per-agent `state` maps to `WorkflowAgentStatus` (`DisplayStatus` plus `failed` — preserved so the detail panel can sort failed agents first and roll them up); run `status` maps to `WorkflowRunStatus` (`completed` / `running` / `failed` / `incomplete`). Sidecar roll-up numbers are preferred over recomputation (retries are surfaced via `attempt`).

**Workflow-live status override.** The Workflow tool runs in the background, so the lead's turn ends — and the idle timer marks the session `done` — while its agents are mid-sweep. `panelUtils.ts:applyWorkflowLiveStatus`, applied host-side at the sessions↔workflows merge point (`extension.ts:sendUpdate`), upgrades a `done`/`stale` session that owns a **running, non-dismissed** run to `running` (confidence `high` — a live run is direct evidence). This is a presentation-layer merge rule, NOT a SessionManager state transition: the per-session machine stays workflow-blind; the override evaporates the moment the run completes (sidecar) or is marked `incomplete`. `waiting` is never downgraded.

### Rendering

A session that owns run(s) renders as a normal card with: a clickable detail chip in the meta row (labelled `workflow`/`workflows`, or `agents` when the session also has plain subagents) that opens the detail panel **and** focuses the conversation; a **glance-only** roll-up (progress bar + a single count, e.g. `2/4 agents` / `✓ 4 agents` / `run failed`). The per-phase pills, token/tool/duration metrics, and per-agent rows are **not** on the card — they live in the detail panel. Likewise the subagent section on a session card is just the summary line (`3 subagents: 1 waiting, 2 running`); the per-agent rows + result previews are panel-only. The chip is tinted by the **agents' own** aggregate state (`wf-chip-*`: running/waiting/failed/done), dimmed when the parent card is seen/stale. Card-body click opens the **invoking conversation**; the chip opens the **detail panel** (`detailPanel.ts`) beside it. All gated behind `serac.show.workflows`.

Compatibility/safety: malformed agent entries are skipped (the rest still parses); `getWorkflowAgentFilePath` validates `runId`/`agentId` against path traversal and existence-checks before returning.

## Detail panel (source-keyed agent navigator)

One reused editor-area webview (`detailPanel.ts` host + `detailView.ts` frontend, `ViewColumn.Beside`) serves three drill-ins that share a parent → children shape. The card/header chip posts `openDetail { source, containerId, sessionId }` and also focuses the invoking conversation (the panel docks beside it); the host builds a normalised `DetailModel` (header chips + metrics, left-pane groups → agents) and the frontend renders it generically. The reader resolves the selected agent's transcript on demand (`viewAgent` → injected `resolveAgentFile` → `parseTranscript()`), leads with the agent's **inception brief** (its first prompt turn, pulled out and pinned in a collapsible block at the top), and the header's "↗ open conversation" jumps back to the invoking session. Turn roles: a user-role JSONL record that carries **only `tool_result` blocks** is plumbing riding back to the assistant, not a prompt — `parseTranscript()` gives it role `tool` and the reader labels it `tool result` (recessed styling); only records with genuine text keep the `prompt` label (and only those qualify as the inception brief). The left nav collapses to a rail to free reader width.

**View switcher (session-card sources).** A session's agents can come from more than one source — each workflow run it owns, plus its plain Task subagents — so the card shows a **single** chip (specifically labelled when one source exists, neutral `agents` when both) and the panel header carries a **view switcher** (`buildViewChoices`, generalising the old run switcher) across every workflow run + a `Subagents` entry. Selecting a chip posts `selectDetailView { id, kind }`; the host flips `source` (and `selectedRunId` for a workflow view) and re-renders. `views` is omitted when only one view exists. The `team` source is a separate surface (team-group header) and has no view switcher. **The switcher chips are grouped by source** (`detailView.ts:renderSwitcher` — Workflows / Subagents / Agent team) with sub-labels when more than one kind is present, flat otherwise.

**Left-nav collapse.** The agent list collapses to a thin rail to hand width to the reader. Collapse is **manual** (the `‹`/`☰` toggle) — selecting an agent never auto-collapses, so you can click through the roster. State lives as a `nav-collapsed` class on the persistent `#wf-root`; the toggle handler flips the class **without re-rendering**, so the existing `.wf-nav` width animates (and the `flex:1` reader widens in lockstep) instead of being destroyed and rebuilt. The full roster is always in the DOM (CSS clips/fades it when collapsed); `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the transition. Collapsing also drops the reader's 80ch reading measure (`#wf-root.nav-collapsed .wf-reader-body > *`) — the collapse is an explicit ask for width, so the transcript widens to essentially the full pane.

| Source | Chip / entry point | Left-pane grouping | Transcript resolver |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| `workflow` | session-card chip (`workflow`/`workflows`, or `agents` when subagents also present) | phases → agents (`runId` is the group key) | `getWorkflowAgentFilePath(runId, agentId)` |
| `subagents` | session-card chip (`subagents`, or folded into `agents`; gated on `serac.show.subagents`) | flat list of the session's Task subagents | `getSubagentFilePath(sessionId, agentId)` → `<sessionDir>/subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl` |
| `team` | `view agent team →` on the team-group header | flat roster (tmux **and** in-process members), keyed by member name | `getTeamAgentFilePath(teamId, memberName)` |

`getTeamAgentFilePath` resolves a member with its own `sessionId` directly; for a null-sessionId member it scans the lead session's `subagents/agent-*.meta.json` for `agentType === memberName` (matched only against roster names — tmux entries unioned with `inProcessMembers` — so it can't collide with a plain Task subagent), returning the sibling `agent-<hash>.jsonl` (newest by mtime when re-runs leave duplicates). All resolvers validate ids against path traversal and existence-check before returning; an unresolved agent yields a graceful "Transcript not available yet." note.

The roster view renders in-process members as rows (`detailPanel.ts:inProcessRosterRows`), with status borrowed from the lead's live subagent tracking (matching tracked agent running → `running`, else the idle default `done`); `alive` carries teammate liveness. A roster member's transcript also gets the queued-inbox tail (same read-side peek as the Teammates view, resolved by member name via `inboxTargetForRosterMember` — read-only; the composer/write path stays pinned to the subagents source). The roster **chip** is offered only when the team has tmux members: for an all-in-process team the deduped Teammates view is a superset *with* the composer, so the roster chip would be pure redundancy (kept while active so the switcher reflects the visible view).

**Teammates dedupe** (`detailPanel.ts:teamSubagentRows`). A team lead's subagent rows are framed per-roster: roster-matched rows are teammates, deduped to ONE row per CURRENT member — re-spawn rounds leave stale duplicates, and the inbox keys by name, so extras only mislead. On a name collision the last (newest) row wins, except a running row always beats a finished one; the kept row is labelled with the member name and ordered by the roster. Non-roster rows (Explore, general-purpose, leftovers from earlier work in the same session) split into an "Other subagents" group when both kinds exist — both groups share the `''` key so card deep-links keep resolving. The view-switcher roll-ups use the same deduped rows (`subsForViewChoices`) so chip tooltips match what opening the view shows.

### Transcript timestamps

Each turn carries a quiet relative-then-absolute time label (`detailView.ts:formatRelativeTime`/`renderTime`): `just now` → `Nm ago` → `Nh ago`, crossing over to an absolute date (`6 Jun`, with the year when not current) once ≥ ~24 h old. The full local date-time is always on hover (`title`). The host already populates `TranscriptEntry.timestamp` from the JSONL; the webview is a browser context, so `Date` is unrestricted here. The inception-brief head is stamped too; a record with no parseable timestamp renders no label.

### Live transcript streaming + intuitive scroll

A running agent's transcript streams: one persistent `setInterval` (`startRefreshLoop`, paused while `document.hidden`) re-requests `viewAgent` for the selected agent **only while its status is `running`**, at a steady ~2.5 s cadence. The cache is not touched on a refresh tick, so the current turns stay visible until the refreshed ones swap in (no loading flash). The host re-reads + re-posts on each `viewAgent` (incremental tailing is a deferred optimisation).

Scroll is intent-aware (`detailViewScroll.ts`, a pure helper so it's unit-testable without a layout engine): on **agent change** the reader starts at the **top** (read the brief); on the **same agent while already at the bottom** it sticks to the **bottom** (live tail); on the **same agent while scrolled up** it preserves the prior offset (appended turns stay below the fold, nothing jumps). "At the bottom" is `isNearBottom` within `STICK_THRESHOLD_PX` (40 px).

### Teammate messaging (experimental — the only write into `~/.claude/`)

Behind `serac.experimental.teammateMessaging` (default off), an inline composer at the foot of a **live in-process teammate's** transcript writes a message directly into that member's inbox (`~/.claude/teams/<team>/inboxes/<member>.json`) — Serac's sole write into `~/.claude/`. "Live" is **roster presence, not subagent status**: an in-process teammate idling between messages reads `done` to Task tracking yet is alive and listening on its inbox, so the gate is `teammate && alive` (`alive` = member name still in the team config — members are removed on shutdown — AND the lead process not registry-confirmed dead). Roster matching unions the config's tmux entries with `inProcessMembers` (the parser excludes in-process members from `agents` because they surface as the lead's subagents, but their names must stay matchable — an all-in-process team would otherwise have an empty roster and the composer could never appear). Direct delivery bypasses the team lead and has **no delivery guarantee** (the member drains its inbox on its own ~5-6 s poll; a send in that drain window can be lost — the UI discloses this and says to resend if unconfirmed). The sender label (`from`) is `serac.experimental.operatorName`, synthesized **server-side** (never accepted from the webview, so no lead/member impersonation).

Flow: the composer (a persistent sibling **outside `#wf-root`** so `render()`'s `innerHTML` swap never wipes a draft) posts `sendTeammateMessage { source, containerId, agentId, text }`. The host handler (`detailPanel.ts:handleSendTeammateMessage`) fails closed at every step, **in this order**: (1) re-check the flag server-side (a webview-cached flag is never trusted); (2) `validation.ts:parseTeammateMessageCommand` — pins `source === 'subagents'`, path-safe + 64-char-capped ids, bounded text, and never reads a webview `from`; (3) synthesize + validate `operatorName`; (4) `teamDiscovery.resolveInboxTarget` maps the orchestrator session + subagent hash → `{ teamDir, member }` by **roster** (reads the one `agent-<hash>.meta.json`, size-capped, accepts `agentType` only if it's a current roster name); (5) `teammateInbox.ts:appendInboxMessage` writes. Errors surface **in-webview only** (a toast would steal focus); the OutputChannel logs **metadata only** (never the message text — it could carry a pasted secret).

`teammateInbox.ts` is the hardened write boundary (pure `fs`, unit-tested): realpath/lstat **confinement** under `<teamsDir>/<team>/inboxes/` (a symlinked team dir, inboxes dir, or target file is refused); a **schema-strict kill-switch** read (non-array / unparseable / forbidden-key shape → refuse rather than overwrite, foreign entries preserved verbatim) opened with **`O_NOFOLLOW`** so a symlink swapped into the target after the confinement check is refused (`ELOOP`), not read through; an **atomic** write (crypto-random temp + exclusive `wx` create at `0o600` + rename — and `rename` *replaces* a symlink at the destination rather than following it, so the write side is symlink-safe too); a **per-inbox serialised queue** (depth-capped, so a burst can't grow unbounded; an `EEXIST` from a second writer racing the `inboxes/` creation is absorbed and re-validated, not surfaced raw); a **ring-buffer** size cap; and **NFKC normalisation with rejection of control/bidi characters** (which render invisibly but still reach the receiving LLM, so they could hide injected instructions). The team-discovery read path that feeds it is size-capped to match (1 MB per `config.json`, 64 KB per `agent-*.meta.json`). After a send, the webview bursts the refresh loop to ~1 s for ~15 s to catch the reply. The composer is gated client-side too (display-only flag + live-teammate check), but the host re-check is the authority. Residual, disclosed risks: the drain-window race, prompt-injection of the receiving agent (receiver-side framing belongs in `serac-snowmelt-companion`), and a fully-compromised `~/.claude` (already game-over).
